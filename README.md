## Hangman ðŸ˜µðŸ”ª
Hangman is a guessing game where a hidden word, phrase, or sentence is provided and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.

# Instructions

The objective is to guess the word before the hanging man is completed. The user will be given a random word and needs to guess it, one letter at a time.
